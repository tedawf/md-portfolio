        I started off as a game artist in the Games Design and Development
        course at Singapore Polytechnic before I was forced to learn
        programming. I hated it at first but gradually came to love making games
        with it. Or it could be I realised I had no talent in art.

        During my internships, I helped build mobile apps, websites, blockchain
        apps and databases. Although I came from a game development background,
        I enjoyed making other non-game applications. The world of software
        development is vast and I can't wait to see what I can build.

          Anyways, fast forward to today, I realised I could build more than
          just games.
